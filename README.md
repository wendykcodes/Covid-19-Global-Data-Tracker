Project Name : COVID-19 GLOBAL DATA TRACKER

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, focusing on case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries. 
The analysis provides visualizations of key metrics and explores patterns in the pandemic's progression.

OBJECTIVES:

    - Explore the structure and completeness of COVID-19 data

    - Compare pandemic trends across selected countries

    - Visualize case growth, death rates, and vaccination progress

    - Identify patterns and disparities in global pandemic response

    - Practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES:

    - Python (primary programming language)

    - Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)

    - Matplotlib (basic data visualization)

    - Seaborn (enhanced statistical visualizations)

    - Plotly (interactive choropleth map - optional)

    - Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive analysis)

PROCESS:

    Prerequisites:

        Install Python 3.x

        Install required packages: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter

    Running the analysis:

        Download the dataset from Our World in Data

        Save as owid-covid-data.csv in the project folder (it is included in this repository)

        Run the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code


KEY INSIGHTS:

    - Developed nations showed faster vaccination rollouts compared to developing countries

    - Death rates varied significantly between countries, likely reflecting healthcare system differences

    - Case growth patterns revealed distinct pandemic waves in some countries versus more continuous growth in others

    - Data completeness issues were observed, particularly for vaccination metrics in earlier months

REFLECTIONS:

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding global health crises. The visualizations clearly show disparities in how different countries experienced and responded to the pandemic. Future enhancements could include:

    - More sophisticated statistical analysis

    - Interactive dashboards for deeper exploration

    - Incorporation of additional data sources (mobility, policy changes)

    - Machine learning models to predict future trends
